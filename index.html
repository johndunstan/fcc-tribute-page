                  Many of Mr. Rogers’ famous sweaters he wore on the show were made by
                  his mother.

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  The reason Mr. Rogers started wearing sneakers on the show was
                  because they made less noise than normal dress shoes when moving
                  around behind the sets.
                </li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister. In 1962, he
                  received a Bachelor of Divinity degree and was ordained as a
                  minister in the United Presbyterian Church and charged with
                  continuing his work on creating and contributing to wholesome
                  children’s television programs, which was his passion.
                </li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers got into TV because the first time he saw a TV show it
                  had “something horrible on it with people throwing pies at one
                  another…” He stated, “I went into television because I hated it so,
                  and I thought there was some way of using this fabulous instrument
                  to be of nurture to those who would watch and listen.”
                </li>

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers was a vegetarian. He didn’t smoke or drink or seem to
                  have any major vices. He also stayed married to the same woman until
                  his death; their marriage lasted 47 years. About the only even
                  slightly “scandalous” thing Mr. Rogers seemed to do, which he
                  revealed in an interview, was that he swam laps completely in the
                  buff nearly every morning of his adult life at various clubs that
                  allowed nude swimming at certain times of the day.

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Unlike on most children’s shows, Mr. Rogers played himself not just
                  in name, but also in personality and mannerisms, changing nothing
                  about how he acted off camera to how he acted on camera. His reasons
                  for this were that: “One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody
                  is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a
                  phony a mile away.”

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers famously didn’t mind if people recorded his show with a
                  VCR, arguing for people’s right to do so in a 1979 case Sony Corp.
                  of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. At the time, it was being
                  argued by the opposition that this constituted a copyright
                  infringement. Mr. Rogers was one of the few involved in television
                  that did not believe so and felt people should be allowed to record
                  programs. The Supreme Court noted that Mr. Rogers’ testimony was a
                  significant piece of evidence that helped lead them to their
                  ultimate decision.

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers did the voices on the show for: King Friday XIII, Queen
                  Sara Saturday, Henrietta Pussycat, Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine
                  Fairchild and Larry Horse, among others. He also composed most of
                  the music on the show.
                </li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers once appeared on the Soviet Union children’s show
                  Spokoynoy Nochi, Malyshi (Good Night, Little Ones) and was the first
                  foreign guest to do so. That show has been on the air since 1964.
                </li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>
                  Mr. Rogers didn’t just try to teach children important life lessons
                  and the like, but he also produced a series of specials intended for
                  parents called “Mister Rogers Talks to Parents About X”, where X was
                  whatever the topic of the day was. These shows were meant to help
                  parents be able to answer any questions their child might have after
                  watching a particular Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood episode.

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa fa-train"></i></span>895 episodes of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood were filmed with the first episode broadcasting in 1968 and the last episode

            You know, I think everybody longs to be loved, and longs to know
            that he or she is lovable. And, consequently, the greatest thing
            that we can do is to help somebody know that they’re loved and
            capable of loving.
